This system is capable of identifying multiple faces in real time. Instead of using the conventional methods, this proposed system aims to develop an automated system that records the studentâ€™s attendance by using facial recognition technology. The main objective of this work is to make the attendance marking and management system efficient, time saving, simple and easy. We have used Open CV techniques to develop this system, histogram of oriented gradient method is used to detect faces in images and LBPH algorithm is used to compute and compare feature facial of students to recognize them.
